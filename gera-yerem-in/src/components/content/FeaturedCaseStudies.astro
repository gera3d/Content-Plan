        <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Agents had almost no online presence (~10 reviews total). They were losing clients to competitors with better visibility.</p>
        <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Built an automated review engine with SMS workflows. Each agent got a custom landing page to showcase their diverse reputation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Scaled to <mark>9,000+</mark> verified Google reviews.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Agents now compete on reputation, not price.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Building custom websites for oral surgeons was taking weeks per client. The agency couldn't scale to meet demand.</p>
        <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> I built a deployment system that launches fully branded sites with custom 4K video content in under 4 hours.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Launched 200+ unique sites in record time.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Agency doubled its client roster and grew from 7 to 50 employees.</li>
        </ul>
