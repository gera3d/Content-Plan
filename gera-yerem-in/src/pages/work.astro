            <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> In the competitive California health insurance marketplace, agents had almost no online presence. The entire organization had roughly 10 Google reviews—agents were losing clients to competitors with established reputations before they could even make a pitch.</p>
            <p><strong>What I Built:</strong> An end-to-end review acquisition engine with automated SMS/email workflows triggered post-enrollment. Each agent gets a custom landing page showcasing their reviews and credentials. Management tracks all review data live in Google Sheets—agent rankings, response rates, and coaching opportunities at a glance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Result:</strong> Scaled from ~10 to <mark>9,000+</mark> verified Google reviews over 4 years—a <mark>900x increase</mark> in social proof across the agent network.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Agents now compete on reputation instead of price. Individual landing pages drive higher conversion rates and management uses review velocity as a key performance metric.</li>

            <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Every new oral surgery client needed a custom website that felt unique—not a cookie-cutter template. But the old process took weeks per site. With 60+ clients and growing, the agency couldn't scale fast enough to meet demand.</p>
            <p><strong>What I Built:</strong> A rapid deployment system that launches fully branded websites in <mark>under 4 hours</mark>—but here's what makes each one unique: every client gets their own <mark>custom 4K video package</mark> shot on-site. Same fast deployment, completely personalized content.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Result:</strong> Launched <mark>200+ oral surgery sites</mark>, each with unique 4K video content. Clients get a premium, custom feel—delivered in a single afternoon.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Agency doubled their client roster. Grew from 7 to 50 employees in 4 years. System's still running today.</li>

            <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> A 40-year-old data recovery company with a website that showed its age. Slow load times, terrible mobile experience, and zero systematic SEO. Marketing team was drowning in manual processes while competitors ate their lunch on Google.</p>
            <p><strong>What I Did:</strong> Led a complete website overhaul—speed optimization, mobile-first redesign, and strategic SEO campaigns targeting high-value keywords. Transitioned the team from scattered spreadsheets to ClickUp with data-driven marketing workflows.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Result:</strong> All-time high website traffic and conversions in 2021-2022. Top 3 rankings for 20+ competitive keywords like "data recovery" and "hard drive recovery."</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> <mark>27% increase</mark> in team productivity. <mark>20% increase</mark> in lead generation. <mark>15% boost</mark> in sales revenue. Proved a 40-year-old company can out-SEO the newcomers.</li>

            <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Solo attorneys in Sonoma County had "brochure websites"—technically they existed, but they weren't generating any business. Zero visibility into what was working. They were paying for websites that did nothing.</p>
            <p><strong>What I Built:</strong> Lead-generating marketing sites paired with LinkedIn campaigns that leveraged their existing professional networks. Created custom reporting dashboards so they could actually track which efforts were driving new clients.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Result:</strong> Clients saw <mark>30-50% increase</mark> in qualified leads on average. Not vanity traffic—actual prospects who converted.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Attorneys finally knew which marketing dollars were working. Visibility went from "I guess it's helping?" to actionable weekly insights.</li>

            <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> GoldMail needed to prove their video messaging platform could drive real business outcomes for enterprise clients. IBM wanted to use it for internal innovation pitches—but they needed help making those pitches actually win funding.</p>
            <p><strong>What I Built:</strong> Worked directly with IBM teams to develop persuasive video scripts and presentations for internal funding pitches. On the B2C side, ran an Avon campaign converting their existing downline members to GoldMail customers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Result:</strong> <mark>2 out of 6</mark> IBM innovation ideas received internal funding. Avon campaign achieved <mark>13% conversion rate</mark>—well above industry average.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Developed white-label features that became major selling points for enterprise clients. Proved the platform worked for both B2B and B2C use cases.</li>

            <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> I founded a co-working space in Petaluma and needed to fill desks fast. Traditional marketing wasn't cutting it—the market was saturated with options and we were the new kid.</p>
            <p><strong>What I Built:</strong> A multi-channel campaign combining marketing videos, a complete website revamp, and on-site networking events. For a networking group partner, I developed scripted video email campaigns that drove event signups and member referrals.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Result:</strong> Closed <mark>5 new tenants</mark> within <mark>60 days</mark>, hitting our occupancy targets ahead of schedule.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> The partner networking group saw their highest Eventbrite signups in history. The video email system became their primary member acquisition channel.</li>

            <p><strong>What I Did:</strong> Developed curriculum combining WordPress development with marketing strategy. Guided students through building real websites and LinkedIn profiles that showcased their skills.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Result:</strong> One student built a community advocacy site for Hispanic business owners that combined storytelling with education.</li>

            <p><strong>What I Did:</strong> Ran workshops showing teachers how to map their existing workflows into Google Apps. Made it practical, not theoretical—showed them the 10-minute wins first.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Result:</strong> One teacher completely restructured her student collaboration flow, cutting administrative overhead significantly.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Contributed to the local school system's shift toward Google for Education—groundwork that enabled remote learning years later.</li>
