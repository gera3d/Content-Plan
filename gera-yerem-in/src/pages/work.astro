        <CaseStudyCard
            title="Automated Reputation Engine"
            subtitle="Client: 57 Seconds (SaaS Platform)"
            investment="Full Product Build"
            timeline="4 Weeks (MVP)"

            breakEven="Month 3"
        >
            <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> 57 Seconds needed a scalable, automated solution to help medical practices generate consistent reviews. Manual outreach was unscalable, and existing tools lacked deep EMR integration.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> I architected the core "Review Intelligence" engine. It integrates directly with patient records to automatically detect happy patients and trigger intelligent SMS/Email sequences.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Result:</strong> The platform now processes thousands of reviews automatically.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Users report a 412% ROI in their first year through organic search growth.</li>
            </ul>

        {/* Case 2: Agency Scaling */}
        <CaseStudyCard
            title="The 'Agency OS' Platform"
            subtitle="Client: Nuvolum (Digital Agency)"
            investment="Internal Platform"
            timeline="3 Month Rollout"
            roi="Saved 570 Hours/Mo"
            breakEven="Month 1"
        >
            <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Nuvolum was growing fast (60+ clients), but reporting was a bottleneck. Account managers spent 8-10 hours/month <em>per client</em> manually compiling data, capping growth.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> I built a centralized "Agency OS" that aggregates live data from Facebook Ads, Google Analytics, and CallTrackingMetrics into a single, real-time client dashboard.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Result:</strong> Reporting time dropped from 10 hours to &lt;30 mins per client.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> The agency doubled its client roster without hiring a single new account manager.</li>
            </ul>

        {/* Case 3: Real Estate CRM */}
        <CaseStudyCard

            roi="Saved $18k/Year"
            breakEven="Year 1"
        >
            <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> This brokerage was paying $18k/year for Salesforce, but agent adoption was near zero. The complex desktop interface didn't match the mobile reality of real estate agents.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> I developed a stripped-down, mobile-first CRM focused purely on speed. The "Swipe to Lead" interface allowed agents to update deal stages in seconds from their phones.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Result:</strong> 94% adoption rate achieved within the first 2 weeks.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> They cancelled the Salesforce contract immediately, saving $18k/year while capturing 40% more deal data.</li>
            </ul>

            roi="+30% App Volume"
            breakEven="Month 4"
        >
            <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> The existing enrollment process was paper-heavy and complex, causing high drop-off rates. Applicants were abandoning forms that took 45+ minutes to complete.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> I led the frontend development of a streamlined, React-based wizard. We simplified the logic, added real-time validation, and optimized the flow for mobile users.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Result:</strong> Application completion time dropped from 45 mins to 15 mins.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Application volume increased by 30% year-over-year, significantly boosting commission revenue.</li>
