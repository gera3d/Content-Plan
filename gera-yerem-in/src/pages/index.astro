            I'm Gera. I've been building software for 15+ years and running marketing for almost as long.

            That combo is rare. Most developers don't understand marketing. Most marketers can't build software. I do both.

            I co-founded 57 Seconds, a digital marketing agency, where I build the tools we use to help clients. 
            I use my own software every day.
