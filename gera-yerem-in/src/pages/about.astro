        <p>
          I'm Gera. I've been building software for 15+ years and running marketing for almost as long.
        </p>

        <p>
          That combo is rare. Most developers don't understand marketing. Most marketers can't build software. I do both.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Actually Do</h2>

        <p>
          I build custom software for businesses that have outgrown spreadsheets and off-the-shelf solutions. 
          Companies come to me when they need something unique—tools that work the way THEY work, not the other way around.
        </p>

        <p>
          My specialty is understanding what a business actually needs (not just what they think they need) and building 
          software that solves real problems. I've seen too many projects fail because the developer didn't understand 
          the business. I make sure that doesn't happen.
        </p>

        <h2>57 Seconds</h2>

        <p>
          I co-founded <strong>57 Seconds</strong>, a digital marketing agency focused on review management and reputation building. 
          The tools we use to help clients? I built them myself. When I tell you I understand both the tech side AND 
          the marketing side, I mean it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I use my own software every single day. If something doesn't work well, I know about it immediately—and I fix it.
        </p>

        <h2>My Approach</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Direct and honest.</strong> I'll tell you if something isn't a good fit. I'd rather turn down a project 
          than waste your time and money.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Results-focused.</strong> My goal isn't to write code. My goal is to build something that makes you money. 
          If the software doesn't pay for itself, what's the point?
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Long-term thinking.</strong> I build software that scales with you. Not band-aids that need replacing in 
          two years.
        </p>

        <h2>Outside Work</h2>

        <p>
          When I'm not coding or talking strategy, I'm usually on the water with my family. River trips, ocean trips—
          anywhere with good weather and space to breathe.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm also still trying to convince my kid that vegetables are actually good. The results have been... mixed.
        </p>

        <h2>Let's Talk</h2>

        <p>
          If you're dealing with software problems—or just want to bounce ideas around—I'm happy to chat. No pitch, 
          just conversation.
        </p>
