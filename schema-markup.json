A phased approach is recommended: build core features first (8-12 weeks), launch and validate, then add enhancements."

Complex systems cost $150,000-$500,000+ requiring 6-12+ months. Budget an additional 15-20% of development cost annually for hosting and maintenance. Custom software typically breaks even in 2-4 years when replacing existing subscriptions."

There are no licensing fees or vendor lock-in. You have the license to modify, extend, or hire any developer to work on it. This is a key advantage over SaaS solutions where you own nothing."

If standard processes work fine and budget is limited, stick with off-the-shelf solutions."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Custom software typically delivers ROI through: elimination of subscription costs (average $20,000-$50,000/year saved), reduced workaround time (25-40% productivity increase), decreased error rates, and increased capacity without adding staff. Most businesses see break-even in 2-4 years with typical ROI of 150-400% over 5 years. After year 3-4, custom becomes significantly cheaper than SaaS while you own a valuable business asset."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Yes, if the system has an API or accessible database, custom software can integrate. Common integrations include CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot), accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero), e-commerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce), payment processors (Stripe, PayPal), email platforms (Mailchimp, SendGrid), and Google Workspace/Microsoft 365. Integration capabilities are a major advantage of custom software over limited off-the-shelf integrations."

Budget 15-20% of development cost annually. For example, a $75,000 project requires $11,000-$15,000/year in ongoing costs. This is typically much less than escalating SaaS subscriptions."

Ask to see 3 similar completed projects, speak with past clients, understand their testing and security processes, and confirm you'll own all code. Avoid developers who guarantee fixed prices without requirements, say yes to everything, have no portfolio, or won't discuss maintenance."
