### SECTION 10: Frequently Asked Questions (300 words)

**H2: Custom Business Software FAQ**

**Q: How long does custom software take to build?**
A: Typically 2-6 months for most business applications. Simple tools can be done in weeks; complex systems may take 6-12 months. We use phased approaches to get you working software sooner.

**Q: What if my needs change during development?**
A: We build in flexibility with 2-week sprints. Changes are expected and manageable. We discuss impact on timeline and budget before proceeding.

**Q: Who owns the code?**
A: You do! All custom software we build is 100% owned by you. No licensing fees, no vendor lock-in.

**Q: What about ongoing maintenance?**
A: We offer maintenance plans starting at $XXX/month for hosting, updates, and support. Many clients handle simple updates themselves after training.

**Q: Can it integrate with [specific software]?**
A: Most likely yes! If it has an API or database we can access, we can integrate. During consultation, we'll confirm compatibility.

**Q: What if you're hit by a bus?**
A: You own all code and documentation. We recommend backup developers or can set you up with maintenance providers. Clean code means any developer can work on it.

**Q: Is custom software secure?**
A: When built properly, yes - often more secure than off-the-shelf. We follow industry best practices, conduct security audits, and can meet compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOC2, etc.).

**Q: Can I start with something small?**
