# Today's Accomplishments - November 24, 2025

## 🚀 Major Projects Completed

### 1. Content Strategy Dashboard Enhancement
**What you built:** Comprehensive `.github/copilot-instructions.md` AI coding guidelines document

**Key features:**
- Complete architecture documentation for your 3398-line Streamlit dashboard
- 9-tab layout patterns (Strategy, Tools, Calendar, Opportunities, Distribution, etc.)
- Development workflows and command references
- Brand voice guidelines for Gera Yeremin's content
- File organization and testing strategies

**Impact:** Any AI coding assistant (GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT) can now immediately understand your Content Strategy Dashboard project and help you build features faster.

### 2. AI Tool Installation & Configuration
**What you set up:** Complete AI development environment on your Intel Mac

**Installed tools:**
- ✅ **Claude Desktop** (v0.14.10) - Installed via Homebrew with MCP server support
- ✅ **ChatGPT Desktop** (Intel x64 version) - Downloaded directly since Homebrew only had ARM version
- ✅ **OpenAI Codex CLI** (v0.63.0) - Installed globally via npm, authenticated and ready

**MCP Server Configuration:**
- Configured Chrome MCP server (`@automatalabs/mcp-server-chrome@latest`)
- Configured Filesystem MCP server for Documents and Desktop access
- Created dedicated Chrome profile at `~/.config/mcp-chrome-profile` for persistent logins
- Set up remote debugging on port 9222

**Configuration files created:**
- `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- `~/Library/Application Support/OpenAI/ChatGPT/mcp_config.json`

### 3. Platform Account Tracking System
**What you built:** Complete account management infrastructure for 11 distribution platforms

**Components created:**
- `platform_accounts.json` - Centralized tracking with status, URLs, notes
- `account_setup_tracker.html` - Interactive progress tracker with localStorage auto-save
- `setup_accounts_guide.md` - Step-by-step setup instructions for each platform
- `platform_status_summary.md` - Quick reference status overview
- Dashboard Tab 9 integration - Live status display with color coding

**Platforms tracked:**
- Medium (DA: 95)
- LinkedIn (DA: 99)
- Dev.to (DA: 85)
- YouTube (DA: 100)
- Reddit, Quora, Twitter/X, Hacker News, GitHub, Substack
- 57seconds.com (main hub)
